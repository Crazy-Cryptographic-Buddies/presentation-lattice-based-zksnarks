\begin{frame}{Introduction}
	Lattice-based SNARKs require either 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item designated verifiers \cite{GennaroMNO18, IshaiSW21} or 
		\item linear-time verification \cite{AttemaCK21, BootleCS21}.
	\end{itemize}

	Contributions from the paper \cite{AlbrechtCLMT22}:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Translation technique from pairing-based to lattice-based.
		\item Vector commitment for constant-degree polynomials.
		\item New lattice assumptions: $\kmisis$ and $\krisis$, implying post-quantum security.
		\item New applications: recursive composition, aggregation of GPV signatures and adaptor signatures.
	\end{itemize}
